# CS444_PROJECT

For our final project, we used https://www.kaggle.com/code/jvthunder/lstm-baseline-for-starters-sign-language as the base notebook and developed several new model structures for this problem. Our final model, Split GRU, achieves a binary validation accuracy of 0.74 and categorical accuracy of 0.9. This is a significant improvement compared to our baseline model.
